# Public-Sector-Emergency-Dashboard
This project showcases an Emergency Incident Dashboard developed in Power BI to analyze and visualize emergency response data. The dashboard is designed to help city administrators, emergency response managers, and analysts gain actionable insights into patterns of emergency calls, incident types, locations, and response times.

### 1. About

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of emergency incident data using a Power BI interactive dashboard. The purpose of the dashboard is to provide decision-makers, emergency response managers, and city administrators with actionable insights into the patterns, frequency, and locations of emergency calls. By leveraging data visualizations, the dashboard highlights key metrics such as incident types, average daily incidents, time from call to arrival, geographic distribution, and temporal trends. The ultimate goal is to improve resource allocation, response times, and overall emergency management efficiency.

### 2. Key Insights

- **Incident Type**:
 A total of **10,041 incidents** are recorded, with fire-related incidents representing the vast majority (**91%**), followed by gas leaks (**9%**) and other categories (**1%**). This distribution underscores the centrality of fire emergencies in resource planning and safety interventions.

- **Most Common Incidents**:
 The most frequent individual emergencies include fire alarms in assembly buildings (**6,849 cases**), grass/brush fires (**865**), odor of gas or smoke (**829**), vehicle fires (**476**), and residential fires (**258**). These insights highlight both the prevalence of false alarms and the recurring risk factors that emergency services must address.

- **Daily Trend**:
 Incident frequency varies considerably from day to day. A recent trend shows a decline of **67 incidents compared to the previous day**. Monitoring these fluctuations provides a valuable perspective on workload patterns and helps forecast staffing needs.

- **Top Locations**:
 Emergency incidents are concentrated in specific areas. The highest numbers were recorded in **zip code 30312 (1,286 cases)**, followed by 30310 (890), 30309 (874), 30318 (829), and 30363 (730). Each of these locations averages between 2–5 incidents daily. Geographic analysis ensures targeted resource deployment and highlights communities requiring proactive safety measures.

- **Heat Map (Incidents by Hour and Day)**:
 The heat map visualization reveals clear temporal patterns. Incidents peak between **08:00 and 12:00**, where daily volumes consistently exceed 120–170 calls. Late-night and early-morning hours (02:00–06:00) record significantly fewer incidents. Fridays and Saturdays experience elevated activity compared to weekdays, pointing to increased risks associated with weekends. This information supports optimized scheduling of personnel and resources.

- **Recent Incidents & Response Times**:
 The dashboard also presents a dynamic table of recent incidents, including type, location, reporting station, and time to dispatch, en route, and arrival. Example records show arrival times ranging from **7 minutes to 19 minutes** after dispatch, highlighting both efficient responses and areas for improvement. This detail strengthens accountability and operational monitoring.

### 3. Summary

The Power BI incident dashboard provides a structured, data-driven view of emergency response activity. Key findings show that fire-related incidents dominate, with a strong concentration in specific Atlanta zip codes. Temporal analysis highlights peak risks during late mornings and weekends, while spatial insights reveal priority areas for resource allocation. Detailed breakdowns of recent cases and response times further emphasize the need for ongoing monitoring and balanced station workloads. Collectively, these visualizations form a powerful decision-support tool, enabling leadership to reduce risks, enhance preparedness, and strengthen public safety outcomes.
